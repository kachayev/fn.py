    Skew heaps may be described with the following recursive definition:
    * a heap with only one element is a skew heap
    * the result of skew merging two skew heaps is also a skew heap

    In Haskell type definition it should looks like following:
    data Skew a = Empty | Node a (Skew a) (Skew a)

    In Haskell type definition it should looks like following:

    Pairing heap has and excellent practical amortized performance. The amortized
    time per extract is less than O(log n), find-min/find-max, merge and insert are O(1).
